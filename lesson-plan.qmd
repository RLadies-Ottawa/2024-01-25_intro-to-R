## 🧊Introduction and Icebreaker (5 min)

-   Introduce yourself

-   Encourage everyone to briefly share their background and interest in learning R (in the chat)

-   Explain the agenda

-   Let the participants know that the code will be shared on GitHub

## 🌐Overview of R (5 min)

-   R is a programming language and environment designed for statistical computing and data analysis

-   It provides a wide range of statistical and graphical techniques, making it a powerful tool for data manipulation, exploration, visualization, and modeling

-   Advantages

    -   Free software environment that is accessible to everyone

    -   Community-developed code enhancements and bug fixes; a large, active community contributes to its extensive collection of packages

-   Disadvantages

    -   Can be slower than comparable languages like Python

    -   Might not handle memory as efficiently as other languages (e.g., Python)

## 💻Getting started with R on Posit Cloud (5 min)

-   *Why are we using Posit Cloud?*

    -   Instructors and students only need a browser to access the RStudio IDE; no installation or complex configuration required

    -   Ensures consistent environment across devices

-   *What is the purpose of each pane?*

    -   Script editor: writing and editing R code

        -   🏃Write a basic mathematical operation

    -   Console: executing R code and displaying output

        -   🏃Execute the code by selecting the code and clicking on the "Run" button

        -   🏃Execute the code using the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl/Cmd + Enter)

    -   Environment: displaying objects, variables, and their values

    -   Files/Plots/Packages: managing files, displaying plots, handling packages

## 1️⃣Data types and variables (10 min)

-   Data types define the format in which data is stored and the operations that can be performed on that data

-   There are 4 data types:

    1.  Numeric: integers and decimal numbers

        -   🏃Create a numeric variable

        -   Variables are containers for storing data

            ```{r}
            num_var <- 10
            ```

    2.  Character: text, enclosed in quotes

        -   🏃Create a character variable

            ```{r}
            char_var <- "Hello world"
            ```

    3.  Logical: Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE)

        -   🏃Create a logical variable

            ```{r}
            bool_var <- TRUE
            ```

    4.  Factor: ordered categorical data

        -   🏃Create a factor variable

            ```{r}
            factor_var <- factor(c())
            ```
