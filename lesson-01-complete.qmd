## 🌐Overview of R (5 min)

-   R is a programming language and environment designed for statistical computing and data analysis

-   It provides a wide range of statistical and graphical techniques, making it a powerful tool for data manipulation, exploration, visualization, and modeling

-   Advantages

    -   Free software environment that is accessible to everyone

    -   Community-developed code enhancements and bug fixes; a large, active community contributes to its extensive collection of packages

-   Disadvantages

    -   Can be slower and might not handle memory as efficiently as other languages

## 💻Getting started with R on Posit Cloud (5 min)

-   *Why are we using Posit Cloud?*

    -   Instructors and students only need a browser to access the RStudio IDE; no installation or complex configuration required

    -   Ensures consistent environment across devices

-   *What is the purpose of each pane?*

    -   Script editor: writing and editing R code

        -   🚶‍♀️Write a basic mathematical operation

    -   Console: executing R code and displaying output

        -   🚶‍♀️Execute the code by selecting the code and clicking on the "Run" button

        -   🚶‍♀️Execute the code using the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl/Cmd + Enter)

    -   Environment: displaying objects, variables, and their values

    -   Files/Plots/Packages: managing files, displaying plots, handling packages

## 📝Quarto document (1 min)

-   Quarto allows you to combine your code, its results, and your prose into one document.

-   It supports multiple output formats (e.g., PDFs, HTML files, Word files, presentations)

-   When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both the content and output of any embedded R code chunks.

## 1️⃣Data types and variables (10 min)

-   **Data types** define the format in which data is stored and the operations that can be performed on that data

-   R's basic data types are:

    1.  Character: text, enclosed in quotes

    2.  Numeric

    3.  Integer

    4.  Complex

    5.  Logical: Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE)

-   🚶‍♀️Assign a string to a variable:

    ```{r data-type-01}
    char_var <- "Hello world"
    ```

    -   Variables are containers for storing data

    -   It's best to use lowercase letters and underscores for variable names

    -   We want to use descriptive names that describes the information held by the variable

-   🚶‍♀️Create a numeric variable:

    ```{r data-type-02}
    num_var <- 10
    ```

-   🚶‍♀️Create an integer variable:

    ```{r data-type-03}
    int_var <- 3L
    ```

-   🚶‍♀️Create a complex variable:

    ```{r data-type-04}
    comp_var <- 3i
    ```

-   🚶‍♀️Create a logical variable:

    ```{r data-type-05}
    bool_var <- TRUE
    ```

<!-- -->

-   🏃‍♀️Practice exercises - Part 1

    1.  Create a character variable with your name

    2.  Create a numeric variable with a decimal value

    3.  Create an integer variable to represent an year

    4.  Create a logical variable with a value of FALSE

    5.  Check the data type of each variable using the `class()` function

```{r data-type-06}
class(bool_var)
```

## 🏢Data structures (5 min)

-   **Data structures** are containers for organizing and storing data in different formats

-   R's data structures include:

    -   Atomic vector

    -   Factor

    -   Data frame

    -   List

    -   Matrix

-   Vector

    -   A collection of elements of the same data type

    -   🚶‍♀️Create numeric and character vectors:

        ```{r data-structures-01}
        num_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
        char_vector <- c("apple", "grapefruit", "banana") 
        ```

    -   🚶‍♀️Check the length of the vector:

        ```{r data-structures-02}
        length(num_vector)
        ```

    -   🚶‍♀️Retrieve the first value of the vector (i.e., vector indexing):

        ```{r data-structures-03}
        num_vector[1]
        ```

    -   🚶‍♀️Retrieve the second and fourth values of the vector:

        ```{r data-structures-04}
        num_vector[c(2,4)]
        ```

-   Factor

    -   Used to represent categorical variables with predefined levels

    -   🚶‍♀️Create a factor variable:

        ```{r data-structures-05}
        social_class <- c("Upper", "Middle", "Lower", "Upper", "Middle")
        ```

    -   Helps users arrange bar graph in desired order when using ggplot2

-   Data frames

    -   A collection of vectors that all have the same length; each column can contain a different data type (in a given column, all values must be of the same data type)

    -   Used to represent tabular data

    -   🚶‍♀️Create a data frame:

        ```{r data-structures-06}
        df <- data.frame(
          name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"),
          age = c(25, 30, 28),
          has_pet = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
        )

        df
        ```

    -   🚶‍♀️Access a specific value by row and column indices:

        ```{r data-structures-07}
        df[2, "age"]
        df[2, 2]
        ```

## ➕Operators (10 min)

-   **Arithmetic operators**

    -   Takes two objects and performs a calculation on them

    -   🚶‍♀️Add 10 and 5:

        ```{r operators-01}
        10 + 5
        ```

    -   🚶‍♀️Subtract 7 from 15:

        ```{r operators-02}
        15 - 7
        ```

    -   🚶‍♀️Multiply 4 by 6:

        ```{r operators-03}
        4 * 6
        ```

    -   🚶‍♀️Divide 20 by 4:

        ```{r operators-04}
        20 / 4
        ```

    -   🚶‍♀️Calculate 17 mod 5 (the remainder after dividing 17 by 5):

        ```{r operators-05}
        17 %% 5
        ```

    -   🚶‍♀️Raise 3 to the power of 2:

    -   🚶‍♀️Check that NOT TRUE is FALSE:

        ```{r operators-14}
        !TRUE
        ```

## 🔣Functions (10 min)

-   **Functions** are blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks

    -   We have already seen the `class()` and `length()` functions

-   They accept inputs, process them, and often return outputs

-   They allow users to encapsulate sequence of operations and make code more modular, making your code more readable and easier to debug

-   Base R's statistical functions:

    -   🚶‍♀️Calculate the mean (average) of a numeric vector:

        ```{r functions-01}
        numbers <- c(5, 8, 12, 15, 20)
        average <- mean(numbers)
        ```

    -   🚶‍♀️Calculate the median (middle value) of a numeric vector:

        ```{r functions-02}
        median_value <- median(numbers)
        ```

    -   🚶‍♀️Calculate the sum of values in a numeric vector:

        ```{r functions-03}
        total_value <- sum(numbers)
        ```

    -   🚶‍♀️Calculate the minimum of values in a numeric vector:

        ```{r functions-04}
        min_value <- min(numbers)
        ```

    -   🚶‍♀️Calculate the maximum of values in a numeric vector:

        ```{r functions-05}
        max_value <- max(numbers)
        ```

-   🏃‍♀️ Practice exercises - Part 3

    1.  Use the `sd()` function to return the standard deviation of `numbers`

    2.  Use the `abs()` function to return the absolute value of a number

    3.  Use the `sqrt()` function to return the square root of a number. What happens when you square root a negative number?

    4.  Use the `round()` function to round 3.14159 to 2 decimal places

-   Getting help with R

    -   The `help()` function or `?` symbol is used to access function documentation

    -   🚶‍♀️Access the documentation for the `mean()` function:

        ```{r functions-06}
        help("mean")
        ?mean
        ```

    -   The documentation provides useful information, including usage, parameters, examples, and explanations

## 👩‍🔧Pipes (5 min)

-   🚶‍♀️ Compute the sum of every number from 1 to 10 and take its square root, rounded to 3 decimal places:

    ```{r pipes-01}
    # this is difficult to read
    round(sqrt(sum(1:10)), digits = 3)
    ```

-   🚶‍♀️Repeat the calculation with the pipe operator:

    ```{r pipes-02}
    # the pipe makes it easier to read
    1:10 |> 
      sum() |> 
      sqrt() |> 
      round(digits = 3)
    ```

-   The **pipe operator** allows users to chain operations together, enhancing code readability and reducing nesting

-   Operations flow left-to-right; sequence of actions is presented more clearly

-   Anything written after `#` on a line is considered a **comment** and is not executed as code

    -   They help to clarify the purpose or functionality of code for other users and even for yourself in the future

## 📦Packages (5 min)

-   **Packages** are sets of R functions, data sets, and other resources bundled together

-   They enhance base R's functionality by providing specialized tools for various tasks

-   In the next two classes, we will be taking a closer look at:

    -   [dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr) for data manipulation and transformation

    -   [ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2) for creating high-quality visualizations

-   Both of these packages belong to the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), a meta-package (package of packages) that helps to transform and better present data
